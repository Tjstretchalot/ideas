# Database

The database will be migrated to postgresql from mysql as it's friendlier
to open-source development and generally nicer/faster to work with. Mysql has
been fairly painful to work with during development, although performing fine
in production.

The database repo will contain database setup scripts, migrations, backup
scripts, and documentation for the database.
